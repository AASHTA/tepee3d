  \title The LeapMotion Service

  \brief This service gives access to a LeapMotion sensor.

  The LeapMotion sensors allows another dimension of interactions to be added to a widget.
  The LeapMotion service allows 3 types of interactions with the sensors :

  \list
  \li Mouse/Touch emulation
  \li Gestures
  \li Hands
  \endlist

  \section2 Mouse and Touch emulation

  The LeapMotion service was developped with the idea in mind of adding inputs to an application without having to rewrite any part of it.
  Therefore, it was decided to gather fingers'positions and simulate touch point or mouse Qt events. In other word that means that any touch or mouse based QtQuick component
  will interact with the LeapMotion natively.

  Here is a list of usual mouse/touch based QtQuick components : MouseArea, MultiPointTouchArea, ListView, GridView, Flickable, PinchArea, etc...

  Mouse events are triggered when a single finger is detected. When the finger tip is pointed forward, a press event is triggered. When the finger tip moves backward,
  a release event is triggered thus generating a click.

  Regarding touch points, there is as many touch points generated as there is fingers over the LeapMotion.

  \section2 Hands and Gestures

  If you want to add interactions only a LeapMotion can produce, a dedicated QtQuick component \l {Tepee3DQmlExtensions::LeapGestureArea} {LeapGestureArea} is available.

  \section3 Gestures

  At the moment the following gestures are handled :
  \table
  \header
    \li Gesture Type
    \li Associated QtQuick object
  \row
    \li Swipe
    \li \l {LeapSwipeGesture}
  \row
    \li Circle
    \li \l  {LeapCircleGesture}
  \row
    \li ScreenTap
    \li \l {LeapTapGesture}
  \row
    \li KeyTap
    \li \l {LeapTapGesture}
  \endtable

  When a gesture is recognized, the proper gesture callback of the \l {LeapGestureArea} is triggered.

  \section3 Hands

  Hands information can be easily retrieved by. Among those information you'll have :
  \list
  \li Hand Pitch
  \li Hand Roll
  \li Hand Yaw
  \li Hand Position
  \endlist

  Hands information can be obtained by the onHandsUpdated callback of the \l {LeapGestureArea}.
  Each hand's data is store in an instance of \l {LeapHand} object.

  A quick overview of how to use the \l {LeapGestureArea}:

  \code

  import QtQuick 2.1
  import Tepee3D 1.0

  Item
  {
    width : 400
    height : 400

    LeapGestureArea
    {
        anchors.fill : parent

        property var handsList : [];

        onHandsUpdated:
        {
            handsList = hands;
        }

        onSwipeGesture :
        {
            console.log("Swipe Gesture Detected");
        }

        onCircleGesture:
        {
            console.log("Circle Gesture Detected");
        }

        onScreenTapGesture:
        {
            console.log("ScreenTap Gesture Detected");
        }

        onKeyTapGesture:
        {
            console.log("KeyTap Gesture Detected");
        }
    }
  }

  \endcode
