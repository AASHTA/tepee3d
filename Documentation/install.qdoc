 \title Installing Tepee3D

 The following steps will guide you through the installation of Tepee3D on your computer.
 As we are still developing the project, we do not offer ready to use packages but the official
 release will. In the meantime, we hope the following sections will be clear enough

 \section1 Prerequisites

 Tepee3D uses several depencies among which Qt 5 and the Qt 3D module. The lack of activity on
 the Qt 3D module eventually lead to the module not being integrated in the current release.
 While waiting for future releases that will contain the module, we created a custom fork to solve
 quickly a few bugs. In addition, to retrieve the sources, you'll need to have Git installed on your
 system.

 This section will explain how to install Qt 5 and how to build the Tepee3D Qt3D Module.

 \section2 Installing Qt 5

 \list 1
 \li \c Download the Qt 5 installer that corresponds to your platform \l {http://qt-project.org/downloads}
 \li \c Install everything (sources are optionnal) (Try to choose a path that you can easily remember)
 \li \c Download this sample project \l {http://quitcoding.com/download/Qt5_CinematicExperience_rpi_1.0.tgz}
 \li \c Open the .pro file contained in the extracted archive with QtCreator and in the Project tab disable ShadowBuild
 \li \c Run the project. If you see a nice demo with particle effects you have installed Qt 5 correctly.
\endlist

 \section2 Building the Tepee3D Qt3D Module

 \section3 On Linux platforms
 \list 1
 \li \c Move to the path were Qt 5 was installed ex: ~/QtSQK/Qt5
 \li \c Move to the sub directory containing Qt 5 ex: ~/QtSQK/Qt5/5.0.0/gcc_64
 \li \c Download the Tepee3D Qt3D Module's sources using the command: \code git clone git@gitorious.org:~lemirep/qt/tepee3d-qt3d.git \endcode
 \li \c Move to the tepee3d-qt3d directory
 \li \c Launch Qmake (Using the qmake from your Qt 5 install): ~/QtSQK/Qt5/5.0.0/gcc_64/bin/qmake qt3d.pro
 \li \c Type: \code make \endcode
 \li \c Type: \code make install \endcode (might need root access)
\endlist

 \section3 On Windows
 \list 1
 \li \c Install ActivePerl \l {http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads}
 \li \c Open a file explorer and go to the directory where Qt 5 was installed ex: ~/QtSQK/Qt5
 \li \c Move to the sub directory containing Qt 5 ex:~/QtSQK/Qt5/5.0.0/gcc_64
 \li \c Using a git software, clone the Tepee3D Qt3D Module's sources \l {https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/tepee3d-qt3d}
 \li \c Launch QtCreator and open the qt3d.pro file in the tepee3d-qt3d directory using either the menu File -> Open File or Project or Ctrl + O
 \li \c Go to the Projects tab on the left of QtCreator's main window
 \li \c In the build settings deselect the shadow build checkbox.
 \li \c Press play on the left or Ctrl + R
 \li \c Once compilation is done, open a terminal (MinGW or Visual) and move to the tepee3d-qt3d directory.
 \li \c Type: \code nmake install \endcode
 \endlist

 \section1 Getting the sources

 Tepee3D's sources are hosted on a git repository made available by gitorious.
 You can obtain the sources at \l {https://gitorious.org/tepee3d}
 They can be cloned directly using: \code git clone https://git.gitorious.org/tepee3d/tepee3d.git \endcode

 \section1 Building and Running Tepee3D

 Once you've obtained the sources, follow this steps to build Tepee3D

 \list 1
 \li \c Launch QtCreator
 \li \c Open tepee3d.pro in the Tepee3D sources directory
 \li \c Go to the Projects tab on the left of QtCreator's main window
 \li \c In the build settings deselect the shadow build checkbox.
 \li \c Press play on the left of Ctrl + R
 \endlist

Now Tepee3D should be build and can be runned using the Left button or Ctrl + R.
Make sure that Tepee3DEngine is selected instead of UnitTest on the target menu of QtCreator that can be opened by pressing on the icon just above the Play button.
