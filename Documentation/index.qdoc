    \section1 Contribute to Tepee3D

    Tepee3D is an opensource project. Therefore, any kind of contribution is welcomed.
    Below several ways of contributing are explained. You can make a difference !

    \section2 Develop Tepee3D Widgets

    One of the greatest feature of Tepee3D is the ability to customize your environnement
    by adding new plugins. In order to propose a wide variety of plugins, we encourage developpers
    to try and implement new features by creating new plugins.

    The following link will guide you through the plugin creation process : \l {Plugins How To}

    \section2 Public API

    We tried to offer a comprehensive yet complete API to extend Tepee3D. If you see areas of
    improvement, aspects that lack cohesion or features you wish to see implemented, do no hesitate
    to let us know.

    All classes in the public API have been documented : \l {All Tepee3D Classes}

    If you wished to implement yourself new services, plugins can register to, please have a look
    at \l {Service Library How To}

    \section2 Help us on design and graphics

    We're mostly a team of developers and none of us has strong design talents. Therefore, if this is an area you feel confortable,
    we would be more than happy to receive design critics and let you help us integrate what you've created.

    \section2 Report Bugs

    In order to produce a high quality and stable application, gathering bug reports is one
    of the best way to direct our efforts. Therefore, if you encounter some king of bug or
    any king of event that doesn't seem right or logical to you, please take the time to fill
    a bug report.
